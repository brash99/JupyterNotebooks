    "## Tall Ships - A Primer\n",
    "\n",
    "A tall ship is a large, traditionally-rigged sailing vessel. Popular modern tall ship rigs include topsail **schooners**, **brigantines**, **brigs** and **barques**. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Rigging\n",
    "\n",
    "The types of rigging on tall ships include **square rigs** and **gaff rigs**, each with separate **topmasts** and **topsails**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Square Rigs\n",
    "\n",
    "A square rig is a generic type of sail and rigging arrangement in which the primary driving sails are carried on horizontal **spars** which are perpendicular, or square, to the keel of the vessel and to the masts. These spars are called **yards** and their tips, beyond the last stay, are called the **yardarms**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The square rig is aerodynamically the most efficient running rig (i.e., sailing downwind).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Gaff Rigs\n",
    "\n",
    "A gaff rig is a sailing rig in which the sail is four-cornered, fore-and-aft rigged, controlled at its peak and, usually, its entire head by a spar (pole) called the **gaff**. Because of the size and shape of the sail, a gaff rig will have running backstays rather than permanent backstays.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gaff enables a fore-and-aft sail to be four sided, rather than triangular. A gaff rig typically carries 25 percent more sail than an equivalent Bermudian rig for a given hull design.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gaff is hoisted by two halyards:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **throat halyard** hoists the throat of the sail (the end closer to the mast)at the forward end of the gaff and bears the main weight of the sail and the tension of the luff.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **peak halyard** lifts aft end of the gaff and bears the leech tension. Small craft attach the peak halyard to the gaff with a wire span with eyes at both ends looped around the gaff and held in place with small wooden chocks, larger craft have more than one span. Peak halyards pull upwards, approaching the gaff at right angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "A triangular fore-and-aft sail called a jib-headed **topsail** may be carried between the gaff and the mast.\n",

    "## Schooners\n",
    "\n",
    "A schooner is a type of sailing vessel with fore-and-aft sails on two or more masts. The most common type has two masts, the foremast being shorter than the main. While the schooner was originally gaff-rigged, modern schooners typically carry a Bermuda rig.\n",

    "## Brigantines\n",
    "\n",
    "A brigantine was a two-masted sailing vessel with a fully square rigged foremast and at least two sails on the main mast: a square topsail and a gaff sail mainsail (behind the mast). The main mast is the second and taller of the two masts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern American definitions include vessels without the square sails on the main mast.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Brigs\n",
    "\n",
    "A brig is a sailing vessel with two square-rigged masts. Their rigging differs from that of a brigantine which has a gaff-rigged mainsail, while a brig has a square mainsail with an additional gaff-rigged spanker behind the mainsail.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Barques\n",
    "\n",
    "A barque, barc, or bark is a type of sailing vessel with three or more masts having the fore- and mainmasts rigged square and only the mizzen (the aftmost mast) rigged fore-and-aft.\n",
